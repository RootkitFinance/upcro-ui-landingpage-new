                                <b>UpCRO</b> is our first UpToken launched with multiple new features including a drip fault, and a dedicated marketing vault. Our drip vault offers a multi-layered, double auto-compounding staking system with a huge, predictable APY and our marketing vault is funded with a percentage of all trade fees as well as <b>11%</b> of the value raised from our Market Generation Event with verified spends happening regularly. We've also included some cool, new, never before seen functions including the ability to convert any percent of price impact directly into liquidity without affecting the user slippage! Mind blowing!
